# Workshop Description
Why a workshop on linear algebra? It’s not just because we (instructors Margot and Nadim) fell in love with linear algebra as undergraduate students. It’s really because if you were to look inside the algorithms we use in data science (and many other areas of science and engineering) you would quickly realize that most building blocks of the algorithms are linear algebra.
If you want to build tools, or if you want to understand the behavior of algorithms better, a strong understanding of linear algebra is super helpful.
 
Of course we cannot do justice to linear algebra in just 6 hours. See this workshop as an appetizer, a first impression, hopefully making you hungry for more. For those of you interested in exploring deeper, we have included in the workshop materials the notes and exercises used in a linear algebra course on campus.
 
During this summer workshop, we will touch on some of the most fundamental linear algebra concepts and operations. We are not assuming any prior knowledge apart from some experience working with vectors in 2D. We will use examples from data science: searching, ranking, a little compression and regression to motivate these concepts. Along the way, we will be introduced to vectors and vector operations,  including the famous dot/inner product , matrix-vector multiplication, matrix-vector systems, the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), QR, and least squares. 

We hope you will enjoy this (first?) foray into linear algebra!

## About the Instructors

![Margot Gerritsen](/assets/img/margot-gerritsen_profilephoto.png){:style="max-width:30%;"}

Professor Margot Gerritsen is a Professor [Emerita] at Stanford and an affiliated ICME faculty. She is Co-Founder and current Executive Director of the global Women in Data Science initiative ([WiDS](https://widsconference.org/) ). From 2010 to 2018, she served as the Director of ICME, and from 2015-2020 as Senior Associate Dean in the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. She is also currently the Chair of the Board of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics ([SIAM](https://siam.org/) ). She received her Ph.D. in Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics at Stanford in 1997. After five years as faculty member at the University of Auckland, she returned to Stanford in 2001. Margot specializes in computational modeling of fluid flow processes, numerical analysis and data science. She taught several of the ICME core and service courses in numerical analysis and linear algebra, as well as courses in renewable energy while at Stanford. Margot's favorite area of computational mathematics is linear algebra and she is much looking forward to this short course. In her free time, Margot can be found outdoors mostly, hiking, biking, gardening and riding her motorbike with husband Paul, or indoors reading or picking her banjo. Margot has a son who recently graduated from Stanford.

Nadim Saad is a rising 5th year Ph.D. candidate in ICME advised by Professor Margot Gerritsen. He is interested in computational mathematics generally and is working on PDE-based traffic flow modeling. He is from Lebanon and enjoys running, climbing and singing. He says: “Linear Algebra has always been one of my favorite topics ever since I was in undergrad and I’m very excited to share that with everyone”.
